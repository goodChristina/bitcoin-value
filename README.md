# Bitcoin Value Checker

My Python script allows you to check the current value of a single Bitcoin using the api from coinbase.com. Don't you wish you had a time machine to buy bitcoin when it was affordable? 

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.something installed on your system.
- Required Python requests library. Install with pip:

  ```bash
  pip install requests

  ```
## Extras
You can use the website-checker in my repository to see if the coinbase api is still running.
